# doublefreed
Linux debugger and it's associated library. 


## Goals of the project

This is a suplementary project to my main game projects. In order to expedite development there I'm going to scrap together a meaningful debugging experience on linux. Essentially everytime my main game drives another batch of hair follicles to disperse from my cranium I'm gonna chill and work on this instead.

## Licensing

Same as all rust projects, dual Apache 2.0 and MIT for maximum utility worldwide.

## Random musings so far

Probably will be terminal bound, but not totally decided on that front yet. Gonna do some research once I have the main lib completed.
